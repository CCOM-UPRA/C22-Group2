The students are encouraged to ask the TA any questions regarding the use of this template. The students must also develop their unique eCommerce site themes and products. Feel free to alter the design of the page to your taste.

There is a missing folder named 'venv' that should be created when you install and activate Flask into the project.

Similarly, .idea and __pycache__ are nonessential folders for the students to copy.

Template for phase 2 of the Databases course and document for installation of the tools utilized.

In here, you will find a template structure for the organization and view of your project. This part of the phase only requires Frontend but WILL have Database connectivity. Each student group will be provided with the credentials and resources for a database online server.

The students are encouraged to ask the TA any questions regarding the use of this template. The students must also develop their unique eCommerce site themes and products. Feel free to alter the design of the page to your taste.
